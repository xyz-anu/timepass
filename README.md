This is a light-hearted project I created on the occasion of Friendship Day as a small gesture for my best friend, Ameya. It is a basic web-based application developed purely for fun, as I continue to explore and learn front-end development. The current version is optimized for desktop view and may not be fully responsive on mobile devices. However, I am actively working on enhancing its responsiveness and design to ensure a better user experience across all screen sizes.

Feel free to explore the project here: https://kyareychikne.netlify.app/
